# coshared-np
CoShared is an app for property and business managers alike. An admin can utilize CoShared to see what vacancies are in 
a particular building, get information about a particular company (like how many employees they have), and even add or 
delete a company from the directory. 

## Tech stack
For this project, I used Vue.js for the front end and accessed the database directly with API calls. 
The database is served from Firebase (using a NoSQL data model in Firestore).
